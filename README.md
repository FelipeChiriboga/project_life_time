# project_life_time

This project allowed me to experiment with different facets that are part of the world of Data Science. 

The reason why I became interested in this project was the curiosity about the time I see my family or friends, living in another country that my family or friends I realized that the time one devotes to their loved ones could be limited, clearly the time I see them is really sporadic. 

For this reason I wanted to use data science to discover how much time I have "left" to enjoy with them, what I never thought was that once I did the relevant calculations I would be surprised to see how little time I could have to enjoy with them. 

For this project I used the life expectancy database of the UN.

Python and different libraries (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy).

Django Framework.
